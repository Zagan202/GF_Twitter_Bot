I rate to this on a spiritual level  You can't code this sass  I'm becoming more and more militantly anti-child in my old age  Perhaps it's that "biological clock" everyone keeps talking about  Does it pass the Turing test if I want to kill it? Woman life  I'm gonna make a second internet because this one is tainted  
I don't normally gush about life changing makeup but Cover FX Custom Enhancing Drops are just as good as every youtuber says and everyone deserves that kind of glowy goodness  Tfw you can't be American and sympathize with Palestinians and the humanitarian issues they face because of a toxic political climate without people thinking you somehow hate Israel too    
This game has taken almost 2 hours to download and I don't even want to play it anymore  Man today sucked so much  If you order from etsy and give the seller a hard time about how long it takes something to ship without reading their processing and turnaround times, you are human scum 
If you get a tracking number and see that USPS is dicking around with your order and still harass sellers (as if we somehow have control over what USPS is doing with your package after we drop it off) you are also human scum  
In honor of Carrie Fisher tonight I will be drinking heavily and marathoning Star Wars  FUCKING HELL 2016 
I want to work out now that I've got a bit of free time and to try and combat the inevitable holiday gluttony   
But I'm also freezing to death and just want to shower instead of working out in the freezing dungeon of the basement
Sooooo tired of deceptive job listings 🙃🙃🙃 working as a sales rep is not working in marketing 
Gonna go stand in the middle of the street and play careless whisper on my saxophone
